### Description

From chemical production to hydroponics, conductivity is a fundamental measurement of water chemistry. The Atlas Scientific EZO-EC Circuit reads conductivity, salinity, and TDS (PPM). Embedding this module into your machine gives you access to the same accuracy and functionality found in costly bench-top conductivity meters. If you need accurate readings that you can rely on, the EZO-EC circuit is the drop-in solution you have been looking for.
