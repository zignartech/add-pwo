### Description

The Atlas Scientific Consumer Grade pH probe gives accurate readings over a wide pH range. This probe has been designed to work will in common pH reading application. By removing the probes ability to withstand extremely powerful acids and bases, the cost of the probe is lowered. This probe will work well for most general pH sensing applications.
