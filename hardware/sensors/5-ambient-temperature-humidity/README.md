### Note:

One. Relative air humidity is a function of temperature. Air temperature has a great influence on relative humidity. Various compounds such as acid and alkali salts have a significant impact on the physical properties of water. The following items should be noted when using it:

1. The temperature and humidity sensor should be installed in a place where the temperature is relatively stable and more represents the measured ambient temperature and humidity.
2. Avoid installation in places where the temperature changes drastically.
3. Avoid installation in places where air flows.
4. Avoid installing dead corners where air will not flow.
5. Avoid using it in a salt spray environment.
6. Avoid using in corrosive gas environment.
7. Avoid installing dead corners where air will not flow.

Second, working conditions:

The sensor has normal performance within the recommended operating range. Long-term exposure to conditions outside the normal range, especially humidity> 80%, can cause temporary signal drift (drift after 60 hours + 3% RH). When it returns to normal after working conditions, the sensor will slowly return to the calibration state. Long-term use under abnormal conditions will accelerate the aging of the product.

Third, storage conditions and operating instructions:

Humidity sensors are not ordinary electronic components and require careful protection. This should be taken seriously by users. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of chemical odor will cause the sensor reading to slip.
