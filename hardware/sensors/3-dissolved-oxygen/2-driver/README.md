### Description

Until you’re faced with the challenge, it’s hard to see why anyone would care about dissolved oxygen. But, here you are.

Accurately calculating the D.O. of water is quite difficult. Once all the mathematical calculations are done, it takes hundreds of chemical titration tests to confirm that the readings are correct over the full scale. The process is agonizing. Fortunately, you don’t have to do any of that. The Atlas Scientific EZO-DO Circuit gives you accurate D.O. readings in Mg/L and percent saturation. Using its temperature, salinity, and pressure compensation features, you can be sure the readings are correct no matter where in the world you are.
